    <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Tools Book (AI工具書)</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>AI Tools Book (AI工具書) Extension (“the Extension”) values and respects your privacy. This policy explains how the Extension handles user data, permissions, and security in compliance with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, share, or aggregate any user information.</strong> All functionality relies solely on user-provided input and is activated by the user. No tracking, background data collection, analytics, or aggregation of any kind occurs.</p>

    <h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not handle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or account details.</li>
        <li>Authentication credentials, tokens, financial or health data.</li>
        <li>Browsing history, form data, or user communications.</li>
        <li>User-generated content for storage, analysis, or aggregation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>clipboardRead:</strong> Used only when the user pastes content into the Extension input. The Extension does <em>not</em> read the clipboard automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>clipboardWrite:</strong> Allows users to copy generated prompts manually to the clipboard.</li>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> Stores user preferences and templates locally on the device. No data leaves the device, and no aggregation occurs.</li>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Used solely to display the Extension popup when activated by the user. It does not read or modify page content.</li>
        <li><strong>host permissions:</strong> Not used to extract website data; only ensures popup activation where needed.</li>
        <li><strong>remote code:</strong> May be used to send user-provided input securely to our API for generation purposes. All communications occur via encrypted HTTPS. No aggregation or third-party access occurs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>All communications with our API use modern encryption standards (HTTPS/TLS). No user data is retained, stored, or aggregated on our servers. The Extension includes no third-party trackers or analytics.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Aggregation</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not collect, retain, or aggregate user data. Preferences stored locally remain on the user’s device and can be deleted by uninstalling the Extension or clearing Chrome storage.</p>

    <h2>7. Limited Use Compliance</h2>
    <p>Permissions and any processing are strictly limited to the Extension’s user-facing features. No advertising, profiling, monetization, or human review occurs under normal circumstances.</p>

    <h2>8. Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the Extension, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please uninstall the Extension.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at:
