AI Tools Book (AI工具書) Extension (“the Extension”) values and respects your privacy. This policy explains how the Extension handles user data, permissions, and security in compliance with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy.

2. Data Collection and Usage
The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, share, or aggregate any user information. All functionality relies solely on user-provided input and is activated by the user. No tracking, background data collection, analytics, or aggregation of any kind occurs.

3. Information We Do Not Collect
The Extension does not handle:

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or account details.
Authentication credentials, tokens, financial or health data.
Browsing history, form data, or user communications.
User-generated content for storage, analysis, or aggregation.
4. How We Use Permissions

All communications with our API use modern encryption standards (HTTPS/TLS). No user data is retained, stored, or aggregated on our servers. The Extension includes no third-party trackers or analytics.

6. Data Retention and Aggregation
The Extension does not collect, retain, or aggregate user data. Preferences stored locally remain on the user’s device and can be deleted by uninstalling the Extension or clearing Chrome storage.

7. Limited Use Compliance
Permissions and any processing are strictly limited to the Extension’s user-facing features. No advertising, profiling, monetization, or human review occurs under normal circumstances.
